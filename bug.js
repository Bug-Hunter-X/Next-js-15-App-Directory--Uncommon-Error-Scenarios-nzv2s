In Next.js 15, issues can arise with the `app` directory's file-based routing system when improperly handling dynamic routes or nested layouts. For example, if a route is defined that conflicts with a nested layout's route, unpredictable behavior might occur, such as unexpected page rendering or routing failures. Another potential issue is related to data fetching within components using `async/await`.  If error handling isn't properly implemented, exceptions during data fetching might not be gracefully caught, leading to silent failures or application crashes.  Improper use of middleware can also cause problems. Middleware functions run before a request is handled by the page component. Errors within middleware can prevent the page from rendering at all.  Finally, issues might surface with the new features of React 18, like concurrent rendering, if not integrated and handled carefully within your app components.
