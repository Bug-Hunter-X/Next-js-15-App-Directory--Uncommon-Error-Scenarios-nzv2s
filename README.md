# Next.js 15 App Directory: Uncommon Error Scenarios

This repository demonstrates some uncommon error scenarios that can arise when working with the new `app` directory in Next.js 15.  These issues often involve subtle interactions between features like dynamic routing, data fetching, middleware, and the integration of React 18 concurrency.

## Issues Covered

* **Conflicting Routes:**  Problems caused by overlapping routes in nested layouts.
* **Unhandled Data Fetching Exceptions:**  Failures to gracefully handle exceptions during data fetching using `async/await`.
* **Middleware Errors:** Errors within middleware functions preventing page rendering.
* **React 18 Concurrency Issues:** Difficulties arising from improper integration of React 18 features.

## How to Reproduce

Refer to the `bug.js` file to see examples of the issues mentioned above. The `bugSolution.js` file provides solutions and best practices to mitigate these problems.  This example highlights the importance of careful planning, robust error handling, and a strong understanding of Next.js 15 and React 18's features.
